# Kotlin For FRC 1.5.0 Newsletter

Hello Kotlin For FRC users!

I would first like to thank you all for installing this extension; the amount of downloads is mind-boggling to me.
This is the new changelog feature that Iâ€™m introducing to Kotlin For FRC.
It will automatically show up after Kotlin For FRC has updated so you know what has changed and when, but for the 1.5.0 version, I decided to use it as a newsletter to let everyone know where Kotlin For FRC is headed.

As with any piece of code, Kotlin For FRC is bound to have bugs and issues lurking throughout the codebase.
As such, I would like to invite everyone to both report and fix bugs.
The [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the repository explains the basics of how to develop Kotlin For FRC for those who want to fix bugs and add features themselves.

Speaking of new features, there are many things coming to Kotlin For FRC for the 2020 season, but they need to be tested in a production-like environment.
This is why I am asking for volunteers, especially those who have access to the 2020 WPILib Beta program, to test out the new features.
While it's not required to beta test Kotlin For FRC, a sign-up form can be found [here](https://forms.gle/mXPFLX4aSKqaQU5e9) and at the bottom of this document.
If you do not wish to get an email or similar form of communication when a new beta is released you can just download the latest .vsix from the GitHub releases page [here](https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/releases).

One controversial feature I have been toying with in the back of my mind is adding anonymized telemetry(anonymous automatic data collection).
Some metrics that I believe would be beneficial to track include Visual Studio Code version and amount of active users.
More details about the proposed telemetry ideas can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/issues/23).
In order to get feedback, I have created a survey that includes telemetry questions and other general feedback type questions.
The link is [here](https://forms.gle/s4Xwqubcrz5ybRgs6) and below.

Once again, I thank you for your support and wish for a great build season for everyone!
