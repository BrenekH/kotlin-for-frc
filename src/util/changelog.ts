	<h1>Kotlin For FRC 1.5.0 Newsletter</h1>
	<p>Hello Kotlin For FRC users!</p>
	<p>I would first like to thank you all for installing this extension; the amount of downloads is mind-boggling to me.
		This is the new changelog feature that Iâ€™m introducing to Kotlin For FRC.
		It will automatically show up after Kotlin For FRC has updated so you know what has changed and when, but for the
		1.5.0 version, I decided to use it as a newsletter to let everyone know where Kotlin For FRC is headed.</p>
	<p>As with any piece of code, Kotlin For FRC is bound to have bugs and issues lurking throughout the codebase.
		As such, I would like to invite everyone to both report and fix bugs.
		The <a href="https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file in the
		repository explains the basics of how to develop Kotlin For FRC for those who want to fix bugs and add features
		themselves.</p>
	<p>Speaking of new features, there are many things coming to Kotlin For FRC for the 2020 season, but they need to be
		tested in a production-like environment.
		This is why I am asking for volunteers, especially those who have access to the 2020 WPILib Beta program, to test
		out the new features.
		While it's not required to beta test Kotlin For FRC, a sign-up form can be found <a href="https://forms.gle/mXPFLX4aSKqaQU5e9">here</a> and at the bottom of this document.
		If you do not wish to get an email or similar form of communication when a new beta is released you can just
		download the latest .vsix from the GitHub releases page <a href="https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/releases">here</a>.</p>
	<p>One controversial feature I have been toying with in the back of my mind is adding anonymized telemetry(anonymous
		automatic data collection).
		Some metrics that I believe would be beneficial to track include Visual Studio Code version and amount of active
		users.
		More details about the proposed telemetry ideas can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/zPaw/kotlin-for-frc/issues/23">here</a>.
		In order to get feedback, I have created a survey that includes telemetry questions and other general feedback type
		questions.
		The link is <a href="https://forms.gle/s4Xwqubcrz5ybRgs6">here</a> and below.</p>
	<p>Once again, I thank you for your support and wish for a great build season for everyone!</p>
